          <p>Love, let's talk about love<br>
            Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br>
            Or do the feeling haunt you?<br>
            I know the feeling haunt you<br>
            This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
            All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
            This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
            All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
            Tell me what you gon' do to me<br>
            Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me<br>
            You can bring a bullet, bring a sword<br>
            Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me<br>
            Fuck you and all your expectations<br>
            I don't even want your congratulations<br>
            I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation<br>
            I hate people that feel entitled<br>
            Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you<br>
            Oh, you important?<br>
            You the moral to the story, you endorsing?<br>
            Motherfucker, I don't even like you<br>
            Corrupt a man's heart with a gift<br>
            That's how you find out who you dealin' with<br>
            A small percentage, who I'm building with<br>
            I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning<br>
            On my momma that's the realest shit<br>
            Girl, let's talk about love<br>
            Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br>
            Or do the feeling haunt you?<br>
            I know the feeling haunt you<br>
            This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
            All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
            This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
            All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
            Skin covered in ego<br>
            Get to talkin', like ya involved, like a rebound<br>
            No control, no off switch and the way that you bringin' me down<br>
            It's a turn on, get it away from me<br>
            Know you mean wrong, keep away from me<br>
            And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah<br>
            I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason<br>
            I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'<br>
            I did it all 'cause it feel good<br>
            You could live it all if you feel bad<br>
            Better live your life<br>
            We are running out of time<br>
            Love, let's talk about love<br>
            Is it anything and everything you hoped for?<br>
            Or do the feeling haunt you?<br>
            I know the feeling haunt you<br>
            This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
            All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
            This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know<br>
            All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer<br>
